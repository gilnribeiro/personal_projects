# Project Summary
- This is a personal project to have a personal dashbord to check the evolution of my investment portfolio
- It was also a way to develop my skills in Dash and Plotly libraries and well as some basic API data requests

## The Project
- By gathering data through a Financial Data API I developed my own portfolio dataset.
- Subsquently after creating a jupyter notebook dashboard and using dash for visualizations in the browser I decided to explore Google Data Studio to perform visualizations and create a better looking dashboard
- For that part of the project I connected the data generation with the updates of the portofio composition and just the time that has passed between the last request and with that script I updated google excel spreadsheet in my google drive which are then being used to plot a dashboard using Google Data Studio
