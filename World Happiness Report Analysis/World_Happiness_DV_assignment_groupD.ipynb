    "\n",
    "### Business problem (Initial Project Proposal)\n",
    "The core business problem which we want to address is what factors play a role in a country’s happiness.\n",
    "The main driver of addressing this business problem is finding out what factors the happiest countries in the world share, but also what factors policy makers can work on in order to improve the happiness of their nation.\n",
    "Within the context of our main business problem we also want to explore varied possibilities such as whether living in Northern countries is a guarantee of happiness and if a nation having a Democratic or Authoritarian regime can influence its happiness score. We also want to find out if we had to pick a country to move to, based on happiness, which would it be.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Datasets used\n",
    "To obtain data on the factors that play a role in a country’s happiness we will start by using a dataset which contains information collected in The World Happiness Report, which is a landmark survey of the state of global happiness that ranks 156 countries by how happy their citizens perceive themselves to be. \n",
    "\n",
    "The data contains happiness scores and country rankings based on answers to the surveys. The columns following the happiness score estimate the extent to which each of six factors **– economic output, social support, life expectancy, freedom, absence of corruption, and generosity –** contribute to making life evaluations higher in each country than they are in a Dystopia, a hypothetical country who scores the lowest for each of the six factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main specific datasets we will use are of the last five years (2015-2019) from Kaggle, being the most recent years with information available. However, the columns are often different between years, whether due to different variables being used (in order to explain one of the six factors mentioned above) or just by the introduction or removal of entirely new variables or factors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, to go deeper into the second part of our analysis, we selected more data outside of our main dataset, which was obtained from the famous **- Economist Intelligence Unit-** curated here, and by merging outside data, namely containing democracy indexes, which contains democracy indexes, and a classification for each country (Full democracy, Flawed democracy, Hybrid regime and authoritarian regime). This index is made each year and is based on several factors such as **– electoral process and pluralism, functioning of government, political participation, political culture and civil liberties –**\n",
    "\n",
    "As already noted, our happiness rankings are not based on any index of these six factors – the scores are instead based on individuals’ own assessments of their lives, as revealed by their answers to the Cantril ladder question that invites survey participants to imagine their current position on a ladder with steps numbered from 0 to 10, where the top represents the best possible and the bottom the worst possible life for themselves.

    "If Democracy and Happiness are not always 100% correlated, as China and Russia demonstrated, we can still confirm that a democractic country is more likely to be happy. And a country with an Hybrid or Authoritarian regime is more likely to be unhappy, or at least, not very happy (happiness score above 7).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we previously showed that Asia and Africa were the most unhappy countries. This current comparison with democracy lead us to conclude that these same regions, Asia and Africa, are also the less democratic.\n",

    "**If we have to advise an individual to chose a country where he wants to be very happy (above 7), the individual will live in a democratic country rather than authoritarian. \n",
